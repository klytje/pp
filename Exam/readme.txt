General information:
This is my solution for the Practical Programming and Numerical Methods exam.

My student number is 201607514. 
Thus my exam problem is mod(14, 22) = 14. 

Number 14: Inverse iteration algorithm for eigenvalues (and eigenvectors)


Solution details:
	- main.cs: Contains a bunch of manual and random tests, all of which will be output to the terminal upon running the 'make' command. 
	
	- dep-mu.svg: "dependency-mu" illustrates how the execution time of my solution depends on the supplied guess Âµ eigenvalue. According to the theory, this should be lower near the actual eigenvalues, and high further away from them. The vertical red lines correspond to the actual eigenvalues. 

	- dep-b.svg: "dependency-b" illustrates how the execution time of my solution depends on the supplied guess eigenvector. According to the theory, this should be lower near the actual eigenvalues, and high further away from them. The right vertical red line corresponds to the eigenvector for the closest eigenvalue, while the left corresponds to the other eigenvalue.
